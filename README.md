# MoesTavern-ETServerInstalls
Files for installing and configuring ET and ETL game servers

These scripts download, install, and configures all necessary files to run an ETLegacy server (version 2.78) with competition settings and maps. It will also configure FTP access for on-going management of the server.

The scripts, system services, configs, and downloads links are baselined to Moe's Tavern's hosts for everything except the game assets installation and key generation.

Note that this install script assumes a bare metal Linux server running Ubuntu 20.xx and >.  The system and packages will be updated before the server installation begins.
